Tasks Details
************************

XBRL tagging is a crucial step in creating XBRL reports. This process involves tagging numerical entities within texts, such as earnings call transcripts, using US GAAP tags.

Two distinct approaches are employed:

* Regular Approach: The input addresses only one numerical entity at a time, and a list of potential US GAAP tag options is not provided. This approach is designed for simple and quick queries. Since options aren't provided, input processing can be faster. Fine-tuned models perform well after learning the tag taxonomy, but base models perform poorly because they lack knowledge of all the valid tags.

* Batched Approach: The input includes multiple (e.g., four) numerical entities to be tagged simultaneously, and a list of potential US GAAP tag options is provided. Providing the options allows the Large Language Model (LLM) to know which tags are valid choices without needing pre-existing knowledge of the entire taxonomy; it can infer the appropriate tag from its name and context. To improve efficiency and reduce token usage, given the large number of tags, multiple tagging questions are grouped into a single input batch following the list of options.

FiNER-139
--------------------
FiNER includes XBRL Tagging tasks with labels from the 139 most common US GAAP tags.
